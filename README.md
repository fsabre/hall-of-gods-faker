# Hall Of Gods Faker

A small webapp to create a fake completion of the Hall of Gods in Hollow Knight.

## Demo

A demo is available [here](https://fsabre.github.io/hall-of-gods-faker/).

## Features

Click on a symbol to rotate between the available ones (none, attuned, ascended, radiant).

Use the zoom/dezoom function of your browser (probably `Ctrl` + `+`) to show the whole screen, depending on your resolution.

Screenshot manually.

## Usage/Examples

![A screenshot of every radiant boss, except Gruz Mother](./img/demo1.jpg)

Generate this, then post it on Reddit with the following title :

> omg this boss is so hard I can't any help pwlease ?

And you'll successfully waste everyone's time.
